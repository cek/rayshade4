Rayview reads a rayshade input file and opens a graphics window into
which images are rendered using GL (SGI / RS6000) library calls.

Support is provided for most rayshade primitives and light sources.
Support for CSG is limited to drawing the bounding boxes of those
objects used in each CSG object.

Rayview is intended to be an example of the kind of application program
that can be written using the rayshade libraries.  You are encouraged
to improve or otherwise modify rayview to suit your needs.

To compile, edit the Makefile, set GRAPHICSLIB and SPHERELIB appropriately,
and run make.
